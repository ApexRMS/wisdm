## Workbench for Integrated Species Distribution Modeling 
<br>

### WISDM is an open-source SyncroSim package for developing and visualizing species distribution models. <br>

The WISDM package provides a streamlined workflow for preparing data, developing species distribution models (SDM), and visualizing model outputs. WISDM maintains records of the various data inputs, processing steps, and modeling options used during SDM construction, and allows users to customize and run existing SDM methods, such as Generalized Linear Models, Random Forest, and Maxent, without having to interact with different software platforms. WISDM also allows users to easily visualize and compare models from within the SyncroSim user interface.


** Should we mention SAHM here? Maybe link to the old software/documentation and mention that this is an updated version...**

<br>

## Requirements

This package requires SyncroSim [version 2.4.20](https://syncrosim.com/download/) or higher.  
Java (**link to latest release**) is also required to run Maxent models.

> Instructions for installing the above requirements for WISDM are provided on the [Getting Started](https://apexrms.github.io/wisdm/getting_started.html) page.
